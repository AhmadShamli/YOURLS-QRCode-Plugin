YOURLS QR Code Plugin
=====================

Allows you to get the QR code by simply clicking on a button in the Admin area (or by adding ".qr" to the end of the keyword.)

Installation
------------

Move the `qrcode` folder into the `/users/plugins` folder. Then, activate the plugin in the admin interface. That's all there is to it.

Requirements
------------

User must have [YOURLS](http://yourls.org/#Install) 1.5.1+ installed.

Credits
-------

Main functionality of adding a QR code is borrowed from [Ozh's orginal plugin code](http://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/PluginQRCodeShortURL).

QR code generation made possible by [PHP QR Code](http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/) (Google's own QR Code generation will be depreciated).
